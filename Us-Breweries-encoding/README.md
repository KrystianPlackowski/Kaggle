# Us-Breweries-encoding
Location encoding process for dataset containing 2407 rows using single batch post request, what reduced time needed to encode to about 10 seconds.

The dataset cointaining breweries addresses comes from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/brkurzawa/us-breweries . It doesn't contain any `geographic locations`, so they needed to be encoded and that's what this notebook actually does.
